# Blue

A Wear OS habit tracking application built with Jetpack Compose for Wear OS devices.

A unique circular display shows days as sectors, and different habits as different concentric layers, enabling you to see at a glance how you are progress across all the different habits you are working to improve.

You can scroll through the habits and days easily to record when you have completed your habits!

Upon first run, loads data from assets/initial_habit_data.json. Once any edit has been made to data, it will instead store data in /data/data/com.example.blue/files/saved_habit_data.json and reload it upon launch. 

The main Kotlin file is app/src/main/java/com/example/blue/presentation/MainActivity.kt
